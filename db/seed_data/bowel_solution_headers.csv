"General Bowel Health Management (Defining a Routine, Defining Success)","A successful bowel program means being able to empty your bowels predictably, regularly and completely, without accidents.  It also means preventing complications and long-term damage.\nSome people think your bowel program starts when you sit on the toilet, but it actually begins with the food you put on your plate. In addition to the techniques you use to empty your bowel, your diet is an extremely important element of your program.\nYour activity level, the medications you take, the fluids you drink and your position during your bowel movement can also have important effects on your program, and you may need to make adjustments over time.\nYou will probably use special pieces of equipment when you do your bowel care, like a shower commode chair or a raised toilet seat.  You may also use assistive devices to help with inserting suppositories and doing rectal stimulation.  Many people also work with an attendant to help them with certain parts of their bowel care, such as transfers and positioning, suppository insertion and digital stimulation.\nEstablishing good bowel habits will help you avoid accidents and prevent digestive complications.  You?ll find that mastering the knowledge and skills you need to manage your digestive system will make it easier to participate fully in all the things you want to do and to have a rich and fulfilling life.\n",1:29,https://www.youtube.com/embed/2K7DByoxias,http://www.sciselfmanagement.ca/icons/pamphlets/RoutineDef.pdf
Lifestyle Management: Diet,"Your diet has a major impact on your digestion, and on how well your bowel routine goes.  Over time, if you pay attention, you?ll learn how different things affect you?what foods you eat, when you eat, how much you drink, and even how much you chew your food.\nIt?s important to notice how your diet and fluid intake affect your bowel program.   You may find it helpful to keep a journal of what you eat and drink, as well as details of your bowel program.

Medication Management,"Medications are an important part of staying healthy for many people.  Medications can relieve symptoms, prevent further problems and replace substances the body naturally produces.  \nIn addition to the desired effect, medications can also have side effects, which need to be considered and managed.  \nMedications can interact either with each other or with things you eat and drink. Some can cause allergic reactions in some people.  Be sure to tell your health care team if you have an allergy to any medication.\nFor all these reasons, it?s very important to work with your health care team to manage your medications.  Let them know about all your medications and dosages including any herbal preparations, vitamins or over the counter medications.  And make sure that you know about all your medications including the dose you are on as well as the times you take them. Use your medications as prescribed and make sure you report any problems.\n",1:39,https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgKukVYOgNY,http://www.sciselfmanagement.ca/icons/pamphlets/MedicationManagement.pdf
Positioning and Assistive Devices,"Sitting up in a commode chair rather than lying in bed will allow gravity to help you empty your bowel. If you need to be in bed, turn so that you?re on your left side for your bowel care.\nYour bowel program can affect your skin too.  The duration of your bowel care tasks and bowel accidents may put your skin at risk for breakdown.\nIn the same way that you spend time choosing your seating and positioning for your wheelchair, it?s also important to make sure your bathroom equipment is appropriate and that it allows you to perform your bowel tasks.  It?s also very important to make sure your equipment doesn?t damage your skin.\nSome toilet seat surfaces are hard, solid plastic, while others are padded, and designed to provide pressure relief.  Work with your Occupational Therapist to figure out what positioning and seating you?ll need to perform ALL of your bowel care tasks.\nFor example, will you be performing your own suppository insertion and digital stimulation, or will your attendant?  This will influence the style of seat you choose and the orientation of the cut-out.\nToileting equipment options include:\n<li><ul>a stationary commode,</ul><ul>a wheeled commode,</ul><ul>a raised toilet seat,</ul><ul>grab bars, and</ul><ul>a toilet safety frame.</ul></li>Make sure you inspect your equipment regularly, check for signs of wear and tear, and replace any broken parts.\nThere are also assistive devices that can help you perform your bowel care, such as a suppository inserter, digital stimulator, or long-handled toilet paper holders.\n",1:41,https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHXuAGQGH8I,
