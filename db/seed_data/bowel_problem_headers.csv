Incontinence (Bowel Accidents),"Accidents happen, and bowel accidents can be frustrating and embarrassing.  It helps if you can take charge of the situation.  If you need assistance, you can make it easier for others to help by explaining the situation clearly and calmly.  You may feel embarrassed, but don?t let those feelings keep you from doing what?s necessary to care for yourself.\nOver time, you?ll find it easier to handle these embarrassing feelings.  Remember that there?s nothing wrong with you?this is just how your body works.  Most people with spinal cord injury deal with the same problem.  Mastery of your bowel program will give you confidence.\nIf you do have a bowel accident, it?s important to get cleaned up quickly.  If you delay, you risk skin damage.  If your injury is above T6, you might also experience autonomic dysreflexia if you block the flow of stool.\nIt also helps to be prepared: if you think you might experience a bowel accident, take a change of clothes and some cleaning materials with you.\n",1:05,https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJCt-SOD29U,
Constipation,"When your digestive system has been affected by spinal cord injury, you may have problems with constipation.  This can mean infrequent bowel movements or it can also mean passing small, hard, dry stools.\nPay attention to the appearance of your stools; if they look like type 1 or 2 on the stool chart, you may be constipated.\nConstipation can happen if you don?t get enough fibre or drink enough water.  Some medications, like certain pain-killers, can cause constipation.\nThe first line of defense against constipation is to increase your intake of fluids, probiotics and foods that contain fiber.  You can also talk to your health care team about your medications and their effects on your bowel program.\nYou may want to increase your dose of stool softener, or of a laxative like psyllium.  Your activity level also has a big impact on your bowel program, so try getting more exercise.\n",0:57,https://www.youtube.com/embed/AztT7Mq6UbE,

Hemorrhoids,"If you make repeated or excessive use of digital stimulation, suppositories and other stimulants, you might damage the area around the rectum and anus.  This can result in hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding and other problems.\nThe best way to prevent these problems is to be very careful when emptying your bowel, use plenty of lubrication and keep your stool soft.  Avoid straining or pushing too hard.\nIf your routine takes too long, more than an hour or so, you may want to increase your intake of dietary fibre and fluid.  You could also increase your use of laxative and use a stronger suppository.  You might also try switching your program to a different time, from morning to evening for example.  And try doing your bowel care an hour after you eat.\nIf you have problems with autonomic dysreflexia, make sure you?re not doing anything to irritate your bowel.  Keep your stool soft and contact your health care provider if the problem doesn?t go away.\n",1:02,https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IeQnzpt4ow,

Autonomic Dysreflexia,"Autonomic Dysreflexia is a serious medical condition that can affect people with spinal cord injury, particularly above the T6 level.   You should be aware of the symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and know what to do about it, especially if you have an injury above T6.\nAutonomic Dysreflexia is caused by a harmful or unpleasant stimulus, such as a bladder or bowel that needs to be emptied, or a pressure sore.  Different people experience different symptoms, and you may notice a variety of signs including goose bumps, flushing, unusual sweating and a sudden, painful headache.\nIn every case, though, Autonomic Dysreflexia is accompanied by a sudden spike in blood pressure.\nIt?s very important to find out what stimulus is causing the dysreflexia and relieve it.  If you find yourself experiencing these symptoms, you should begin by checking whether you need to drain your bladder or empty your bowel, and inspecting your skin for signs of pressure sores.\nIf you?re not able to resolve the issue and end the episode of autonomic dysreflexia, you should seek medical help immediately.\n",1:06,https://www.youtube.com/embed/doRYlIzPMwQ,
